# CauliCare ðŸŒ¿

CauliCare is a web application that helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts diagnose cauliflower diseases using deep learning. Users can upload an image of a cauliflower leaf, and the model predicts the disease affecting it.

## Features
- **Image Upload**: Upload images of cauliflower leaves directly from your device.
- **Disease Prediction**: Get predictions for common cauliflower diseases.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and visually appealing design.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Deployment**: Localhost or cloud platform
